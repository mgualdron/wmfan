VERSION: 0.9.4
RELEASE DATE: 09 March 2000 by albert@tigr.net

	Fixed the security bug. The program now forks
	and the child drops privileges before executing
	an external command.

VERSION: 0.9.3
RELEASE DATE: 03 March 2000 (sashav@sprintmail.com)
       -added range check for values. It seems that on 2.3 kernels
        time can go backwards :)
       -Destroying Icon window prior to main window to avoid shutdown
        time errors

VERSION: 0.9.2
RELEASE DATE: 17 July 1997

	-Minor cosmetic changes.
	 The graph zone is now perfectly square, 54x54.
	 <I didn't like it's odd width! (;-)>

	-All values dealing with pixmap size have been
	 adjusted to accomodate the new `look'.

VERSION: 0.9.1
RELEASE DATE: 8 July 1997

	-Uses correct ordering of PROC data.

	-Increases the differentiation between tones,
	 just a smidgion.

	-Catches a "Once In A Blue Moon" condition.
	   Under various circumstances rounding error
	   results in a pixel count of 55 or 53.
	   To prevent the 55 count from writing one
	   pixel into the edge of the frame, wmload
	   now catches these occurrences and corrects
	   for them.

VERSION: 0.9.0
RELEASE DATE: 6 July 1997

	-Fixed the grayscale problem that occurred
	 whenever the "-shape" argument was used.

	-Implemented the "-led" argument...
	 ...the last release had the argument,
	 however it wasn't implemented...
	 ...ie: it did nothing.
	 Called without the "-led" argument, wmload
	 uses it's default color "LightSeaGreen"
	 [which is the same as the asclock readout].
	 Called with the argument, it uses the
	 named color. If the default color is
	 unavailable, or the named color is invalid,
	 wmload simply uses the 3 green tones
	 found in the "back.xpm" pixmap.

	-Added a "-ver" argument...
	 When used, it prints the current version
	 on stdout. If it is called alone with no
	 other arguments, wmload exits after
	 printing its' version. Called with other
	 arguments... wmload prints its' version
	 and continues as normal.

	-Trapped bad arguments that don't start
	 with "-".

	-Cleaned up the code a bit.

	-Removed unnecessary files from the
	 distribution. <kept README's though>
