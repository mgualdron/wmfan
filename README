wmfan - WindowMaker cooling fan monitor

This is a hack of the excellent wmload application for monitoring system load.

I've added options to change the input file read, the graph scale, and an
option to skip values in the input so that the user can choose what to plot
when the input contains many separate values. (See the man page.)

I've also modified the Makefile so the installation takes place in $HOME.
(Look at the Makefile and modify it to suit your needs.)

To build and install on a GNU/Linux system, simply type:

    make
    make install

I use this in FVWM with the following line in ~/.fvwm/config:

*FvwmButtons(Swallow "wmfan" 'Exec wmfan -u 2 -f "/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon3/fan1_input" -m 5000 -e xsensors &'

HISTORY:
2020-03-11 - v0.0.2 - Added -f, -m, and -j options.
2020-03-05 - v0.0.1 - First working version.

Below is the original text from the README file for wmload-0.9.7.
(Please do not contact the wmload developers with questions about wmfan.)

>================================================<
wmload - WindowMaker load gauge
Updated, cleaned up and "fixed"
==================================================

NOTE:
	This is a load monitor which is designed
	to work with the PROC filesystem. Generally
	all Linux systems come with the PROC fs.
	If you're using a different Unix and it
	doesn't have the PROC fs, first see if
	there is one available... otherwise this
	monitor won't work!
	Work is currently underway to produce a
	more `portable'	wmload that Solaris/Sun/HP etc.
	users can also enjoy.

SUGGESTED INVOCATION (for WindowMaker!):
	`wmload -shape -withdrawn &'

	OR for a different graph color:
	`wmload -led ??? -shape -withdrawn &'
	...replace "???" with a color name
	eg. green, red, orange, yellow, orchid, purple....
	any of your systems standard X color symbols.

SUGGESTED INVOCATION (for AfterStep):
	To load wmload in Wharf, add a line in .steprc:
*Wharf wmload nil MaxSwallow "wmload" wmload -led green -shape &
	...or to run it as a normal app: wmload -led "???" &
	NOTE: AfterStep doesn't require the "-withdrawn" option.

AVAILABILITY:
	The latest release should be available from:
		http://windowmaker.org/dockapps?name=wmload

TODO LIST:
	-Implement alternative `load' algorithms?

LIABILITY & USABILITY:
	As usual, this software is bound by the
	GNU public license. You can use it however

	...that having been said, I think you'll
	like this new version and shouldn't have
	problems with it. Happy load monitoring!
