wmload - WindowMaker load gauge
Updated, cleaned up and "fixed"
==================================================

NOTE:
	This is a load monitor which is designed
	to work with the PROC filesystem. Generally
	all Linux systems come with the PROC fs.
	If you're using a different Unix and it
	doesn't have the PROC fs, first see if
	there is one available... otherwise this
	monitor won't work!
	Work is currently underway to produce a
	more `portable'	wmload that Solaris/Sun/HP etc.
	users can also enjoy.

SUGGESTED INVOCATION (for WindowMaker!):
	`wmload -shape -withdrawn &'

	OR for a different graph color:
	`wmload -led ??? -shape -withdrawn &'
	...replace "???" with a color name
	eg. green, red, orange, yellow, orchid, purple....
	any of your systems standard X color symbols.

SUGGESTED INVOCATION (for AfterStep):
	To load wmload in Wharf, add a line in .steprc:
*Wharf wmload nil MaxSwallow "wmload" wmload -led green -shape &
	...or to run it as a normal app: wmload -led "???" &
	NOTE: AfterStep doesn't require the "-withdrawn" option.

AVAILABILITY:
	The latest release should be available from:
		http://windowmaker.org/dockapps?name=wmload

TODO LIST:
	-Implement alternative `load' algorithms?
